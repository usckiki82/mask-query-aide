Project Notes & Documentation
=============================

* Started by running through some of the Open CV tutorials and examples:

    `https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/df6/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_setup.html`

* Then found this tutorial to detect hard hats as a starting point:

    `https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5270236/Installing-OpenCV-and-ImageAI-for-Object-Detection`

* Learned about types of NeuralNets available
    - ResNet: a convolutional neural network that is built for high performance and accuracy, but with a longer detection time
    - YOLOv3: an implementation of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm thatâ€™s built for moderate performance, accuracy, and detection time
    - TinyYOLOv3: another YOLO implementation, but built for quick detection and performance, with moderate accuracy

* Ran into versioning issues using Python 3.8 and `imageai` pckg, so decided to learn Docker!
    - Install Docker using instructions from website (required WSL2 installation)

        `https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/`

    - Then I followed the tutorial in this URL to learn the basics:

        `https://realpython.com/python-versions-docker/`

* (TODO) Add pylinting etc setup
